Builder.ai，一家曾被誉为价值15亿美元的人工智能初创公司，现在正面临破产保护。该公司原本以其与微软的战略合作和来自卡塔尔投资局的2.5亿美元投资而备受瞩目，但随后其人工智能的虚假宣传被揭露，背后实际上是一个由人类操作的项目。公司因关键贷款机构Viola Credit撤资而陷入财务困境，导致其在五个国家的运营瘫痪。CEO Manpreet Ratia接替创始人Sachin Dev Duggal后，公司进行了裁员。Builder.ai曾筹集了超过4.5亿美元的资金，但最近承认其核心销售数字被低估，并聘请审计师检查过去两年的财务状况。Zero Hash公司的Linas Beliūnas指出，Builder.ai缺乏真正的AI，而是使用印度开发者假装成机器人编写代码。这一丑闻引发了投资者对AI初创公司稳定性的担忧，并促使竞争监管机构审查AI公司的营销实践。

The tech world is reeling from revelations that Builder.ai, once hailed as a $1.5 billion (£1.11 billion), 'AI' powerhouse, now faces scrutiny as its highly promoted artificial intelligence facade crumbles, revealing a human-powered operation behind the cutting-edge AI automation.Builder.ai, the British no-code AI startup that once garnered acclaim for its strategic partnership with Microsoft and secured a $250 million (£184.64 million) investment led by the Qatar Investment Authority, declared Tuesday that it is initiating bankruptcy protection.As reported by Bloomberg, the company's dramatic decline occurred after a key lender, Viola Credit, withdrew $37 million (£27.33 million) from its accounts, leaving a mere $5 million (£3.69 million) in restricted funds and effectively paralysing operations in five nations.Earlier this year, CEO Manpreet Ratia took over from founder Sachin Dev Duggal in a boardroom shake-up designed to restore investor confidence. Ratia has since stated that most of the company's workforce has been laid off. As Bloomberg reports, Builder.ai will now commence bankruptcy filings in its operational territories, including the UK, US, UAE, Singapore, and India.Builder.ai's $450 Million Funding: Big Names, Big PromisesLaunched in 2016, Builder.ai presented itself as a groundbreaking platform, allowing businesses to create customised applications with minimal coding, leveraging artificial intelligence. As reported by Bloomberg, the company accumulated over $450 million (£332.36 million) in total funding, drawing in prominent investors such as Microsoft, the World Bank's IFC, Jeffrey Katzenberg's WndrCo, Lakestar, and SoftBank's DeepCore incubator.Less than two months ago, Builder.ai admitted to revising down core sales numbers and engaging auditors to inspect its financials for the past two years. This came amidst concerns from former employees who suggested sales performance had been inflated during prior investor briefings.'Bots' Revealed As Builders From IndiaBloomberg notes that these allegations initiated a cascade of investor apprehension, internal changes, and an eventual erosion of confidence. Adding to the troubles, Linas Beliūnas, Director of the financial company Zero Hash, recently exposed that Builder.ai lacked true AI, instead utilising a group of Indian developers who were merely pretending to be bots writing code.
'It turns out the company had no AI and instead was just a group of Indian developers pretending to write code as AI,' he wrote in a LinkedIn post. Beliūnas also highlights that Duggal reportedly presented false revenue figures to investors. Remarkably, the company managed to sustain this deception for eight years.Investor Dreams Shattered By RealityThe critical moment arrived when Viola Credit, which had provided the company with a $50 million loan in 2023, took control of $37 million (£27.33 million) from its accounts. This action rendered Builder.ai incapable of fulfilling payroll commitments or maintaining essential operations.Manpreet Ratia informed Bloomberg that the remaining funds, held in Indian accounts, are inaccessible due to regulatory restrictions.The Broader Impact Of Builder.ai's CollapseThe insolvency proceedings at Builder.ai mirror a rising trend of instability within AI startups. Phil Brunkard, an executive counsellor at Info-Tech Research Group, shared with Computer World that many AI companies expanded rapidly, fueled by hype, frequently without robust financial oversight or genuinely unique products.'The Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) is one of the biggest losers in this saga. They led a $250 million (£184.68 million) funding round two years ago,' Beliūnas adds.Competition regulators are reportedly examining Builder.ai's marketing practices, with potential implications for how AI companies present their capabilities to investors and customers.The scandal serves as a stark reminder that whilst artificial intelligence continues advancing rapidly, human expertise remains irreplaceable in many complex technical domains—a lesson that Builder.ai learned through public humiliation rather than honest business practices.As the dust settles, the tech industry faces uncomfortable questions about transparency, accountability, and the ethical boundaries of AI marketing in an increasingly sceptical marketplace.

**Hacker News 讨论：**

文章讨论了Builder.ai公司的财务欺诈问题。公司被指控通过循环交易方案夸大销售额，并使用印度工程师假装成AI产品。尽管有关于公司财务状况的担忧和前员工的指控，但缺乏确凿证据来支持这些指控。文章指出，尽管有关于AI技术的可用性，但公司可能依赖廉价的人力资源来维持其业务。Builder.ai最终承认修订了核心销售数字，并聘请审计师检查过去两年的财务状况。
