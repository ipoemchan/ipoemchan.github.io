文章讲述了作者在开发产品过程中，通过反向工作法（先从市场反馈入手）来验证产品需求的故事。作者最初花费大量时间开发了一个产品，但由于无法制作出简单易懂的演示视频，导致产品在社区中无人问津。后来，作者转变思路，先制作了一个简单的产品演示视频并发布到Reddit上，意外地获得了大量用户反馈和兴趣。基于这些积极反馈，作者创建了“即将推出”的网站并收集了36个电子邮件地址。现在，作者正在与实际用户合作进一步开发产品，以满足市场需求。

It's said that amazon asks their product makers to write a press release about the release of the product and work backwards from there.Working backwards has its uses...I recently wanted validation on a product I had already finished developingI thought I needed it so others will too. I put in a lot of time architecting it, designing it with careful UX and UI.When it came time to show and tell through a demo video i couldn't create a simple enough one that explains what it does.So anyway I posted it in some communities and people we just confused and nobody signed up.So I had to abandon the project as there were no takersCut to about a week back where I had another idea... This time instead of simply developing it further, I jumped straight to see if I can create a explainer video of the product. So with zero expectations about it working I made one without audio or music or even subtitles and posted on reddit.  It was just a screen recording of it working on my laptop.To my surprise people wanted it. Some even demanding it. I quickly put up a "coming soon" website to capture emails. 36 people gave their emails! Many more I could message on reddit once I am ready.Here is the link to the reddit post...

Headline: I made this SEO keyword searching thingie for my own needs... Does anyone want it? Its very ugly at the momentDescription: Lets say you want to rank high on Google for the keyword "pet dog care"Before you write any content, you want to know what questions people ask on Google, Who is ranking on the top 10 and what other keywords do they rank for?, and 'Google Suggestions' for the phrase.So I made one and I find it damn bloody useful when creating highly relevant and SEO potimised content. Wonder if anyone else finds this stuff useful.I have been burnt building unnecessary stuff before so I am very careful to validate first now. I will only develop this further is there is any interest here :-)
-------The ugly video I shared... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-873SkJ2RIlink to the coming soon page... https://keywordranking.me/Now I am developing the product into something others could use in collaboration with actual users and i have to do it fast since so many are waiting. This is a first for me. This is probably what product Market fit feels like... probably.
