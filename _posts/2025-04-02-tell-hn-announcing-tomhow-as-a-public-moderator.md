本文宣布Tom Howard将作为Hacker News（HN）的新版主公开露面。Tom在HN的社区管理工作中积累了丰富的经验，对网站及其实践了如指掌。他将在帖子中发表评论，与作者一起共同管理社区。作者与Tom自YC W09时期就是同学，并赞赏他在社区中的友好和周到。Tom将使用新的用户名'tomhow'来发表帖子，类似于作者在经历类似仪式时改为'dang'。文章还包含Tom关于自己的背景和HN对他生活影响的个人陈述，强调了他对技术和创业的兴趣以及通过HN建立的全球友谊和知识获取。

Hi all,Tom Howard is going public as HN moderator today. He has been doing HN moderation work for years and knows the site and its practices inside-out, so the only new thing you'll see is mod comments from Tom showing up in the threads the way mine do. I'm not going anywhere, so you'll have two of us to put up with going forward :)I've known Tom since he was sctb's and my batchmate back in YC W09. Many of you know him as the kind and thoughtful community member tomhoward (https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=tomhoward). He's still kind and thoughtful, but he's going to post as tomhow from now on (https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=tomhow), the same way I switched to dang when I went through this rite of passage years ago.Below is a bit from Tom about himself. Please join me in welcoming him to this new status which he was crazy enough to say yes to!---YC and HN have been a huge part of my life for nearly two decades. I read pg's essay How to Start a Startup in 2005 after my friend (and later, co-founder) Fenn found it on Slashdot, and it opened our eyes as to how to go about building products and companies. I first signed up in late 2007, and since then HN has been the place I come to find interesting news and discussions.Hacker News gave me a window into the big wide world of technology and startups, that had previously seemed so remote and opaque from where I lived (and still live) in Australia. We were lucky enough to be accepted into the W09 batch of YC, and since then HN has been a place where we could share announcements about the startup, but also where I could share the challenges and struggles I experienced in the startup journey and other aspects of life, particularly to do with health and wellbeing.From the discussions that have happened about these topics I've ended up making enduring friendships with people all over the world, and have been able to learn many things that have improved my life in profound ways. I love HN's ethos - of being a place people come to engage their curiosity. That's what it's always been for me and what I hope I can help it to be for everyone!--Tom
