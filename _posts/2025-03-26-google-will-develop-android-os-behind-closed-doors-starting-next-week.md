Google宣布将Android操作系统的开发完全转移到其内部分支，这意味着Android开源项目（AOSP）将不再公开大部分Android开发工作。这一变化与Google最近的一些做法一致，即在其内部分支中秘密开发Android的大部分功能，而AOSP分支仅包含某些核心组件。尽管如此，Google表示这不会改变新构建的发布速度，而是可能会简化流程并防止分支合并时的冲突。这一变化预计将在下周生效，具体细节将在稍后公布。

For years now, Android has been developed in a way that allowed the public to look in on Google’s work, but that’s now changing as Google has just confirmed that it will start to develop the operating system entirely in its internal branch.

The Android Open Source Project (AOSP) has left most of Google’s work in developing Android as an operating system visible to the public eye. But, starting next week, Google is moving that work behind closed doors.
Google confirmed to Android Authority that “all Android development will occur within Google’s internal branches,” the publication says. This is a shift from how Android has been developed for a very long time, but also aligns with more recent moves Google has been making. For a while now, Google has been developing most parts of Android behind closed doors in its “internal branches,” with the “AOSP branch” only having certain other aspects of Android’s framework (including Bluetooth, kernel, and some other core components). As such, it’s been quite a while since the current state of AOSP is at the same level as Google’s internal builds, leaving developers and others to wait on Google to make a public release to get all of the new changes.
With this change to move everything to its internal, private development branch, Google isn’t changing the speed at which these new builds arrive. Rather, this will potentially streamline the process and prevent conflicts when merging the branches. Advertisement - scroll for more content


This does not mean that Google is making Android a closed-source platform, but rather that the open-source aspect will only be released when a new branch is released to AOSP with those changes, including when new full versions or maintenance releases are finished.
In the end, users of Android almost certainly won’t see any changes from this new structure. App developers will also likely be unaffected. The biggest impact may be on the tidbits caught from AOSP that make their way into the public eye, such as the recent appearance of “Pixel 10” in an AOSP commit. That may be for the best, as those small tidbits can often be misconstrued or overhyped, leading to confusion later on.
A formal announcement of this change is apparently coming “later this week,” with the change itself happening next week. We’ll update this post when Google makes further details available.

**Hacker News 讨论：**

文章讨论了关于Android操作系统源代码可能不再完全公开的问题。一些用户对此表示担忧，认为这是Google逐步关闭源代码、向封闭平台转变的迹象。他们担心这会导致功能被锁定、许可证变更，以及开发逐渐转向完全专有化。另一方面，也有用户认为这是为了防止泄露，或者是为了优化发布前的准备工作。文章中还提到了其他用户对Android系统现状的不满，包括对品牌存在和广告投放的优化，以及对隐私侵犯的担忧。
