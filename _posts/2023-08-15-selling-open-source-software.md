文章探讨了工程师创业者如何为开发者构建工具并围绕其创新建立业务。文章强调了销售对于公司成功的重要性，并针对开源创业公司的销售策略提供了见解。主要内容包括：1）建立受欢迎的开源项目；2）承诺商业化；3）制定开源与付费产品之间的框架；4）构建可工作的商业产品；5）销售策略包括创造新用户、将开源用户转化为付费客户和扩展现有账户；6）创始人需要参与销售并接受拒绝；7）销售的关键在于明确目标并帮助客户实现目标。

Entrepreneurship for Engineers is a monthly column by longtime New Stack contributor Emily Omier that explores the concerns of developers who want to build tools for other developers — and build a business around their innovations. We welcome your feedback, and ideas for future columns.
	
No matter what kind of company you intend to build — open source or proprietary, DevTool or not — at least one of the company founders will have to close deals at the beginning of the company’s life. Even as the company gets larger, founders still need to be involved in sales, especially big deals.
For founders of open source startups (and the sales teams they eventually hire), what is unique about sales when there’s a free alternative your company is also promoting?
I was inspired to delve into this topic after seeing Nicholas Erdenberger, chief revenue officer at dbt Labs, talk on selling free software at HeavyBit’s DevGuild conference. But I’ve also spoken with experienced salespeople in the open source ecosystem to get their perspectives as well. Here’s what I’ve learned.
First, the Basics
Sales are obviously critical to any company’s success, but it’s also not the first thing you do as a company. Once you think about sales as the process of ushering a deal over the finish line, this becomes clearer.
“I’m going to talk about basics and fundamentals, that if you don’t screw up, you will be successful, Erdenberger said at the beginning of his talk at DevGuild. “And that a lot of people do screw up, so we should probably focus on them.”
Create an open source project people love. “This sounds really obvious, but I see people do this all the time: They hire salespeople to help develop the open source project, or help fund the open source project,” Erdenberger said. “This is a really bad idea,”
Made a commitment to commercialization. “There are a lot of technical founders in here who love the open source thing that they built and have to be ready to make trade-offs between prioritizing that open source and that community that you love, and prioritizing building a software business,” Erdenberger said.
Have a framework for the open source versus the paid product. This means a rationale, not a feature list, that can be shared and understood externally and internally, with your customers, community and team. If you have a list of 20 features, it should be easy for all of those stakeholders to see which belong to open source and which belong to paid.
Build a working commercial product. “It doesn’t have to be awesome,” Erdenberger said. But it does have to do what you say it does and provide a value that customers are willing to pay for.
You have to be realistic about where your product is now, versus what kind of customers you are chasing, added Lee Wright, vice president of sales at Quix, a data platform company. If you are a seed-stage company with zero compliance certifications, talking about how to get into multinational banks is just a waste of time.
“I’m always saying that salespeople are not magicians,” said Wright. “What salespeople categorically do not do is generate demand.”
As an open source company, you have to make sure you have the basics in place to drive adoption of your project and to generate leads before you think about hiring salespeople. And even if you’re still at the founder sales stage, you need to have all of these fundamentals in place to be successful there, too.
Sales Tactics
When you’re selling for an open source business, Wright said, you have basically three levers to pull. You can create net new users, convert open source users to paid customers, and expand existing accounts.
Account expansion isn’t much different from a proprietary software sales situation, but the other two can be — especially the process of converting an open source user to paid.
“The most important thing to know as a seller is 99% of people who use your open source project are never going to pay you a penny,” Wright said.
As a seller — and as a founder — you have to be comfortable with this.
“Salespeople who come from a non-open source software background, at first they get annoyed with customers who want to do everything themselves for free,” said Reg Deraed, continental Europe field sales director at Canonical. (And he admits to feeling the same way when he first started working at Canonical.)
But now, he sees every enterprise that uses his company’s product Ubuntu as a win, even if they don’t pay.
For an open source user to convert to a paid customer, Wright said, one of three things has to happen: They are in production and there’s a major incident, the person responsible for operating the software leaves, or there are changes to their enterprise platform requirements.
“If there’s no change, you don’t have a buying trigger,” he said, and they’ll never pay.
But the trick is you want to make sure your phone number is the first one a user thinks of calling if they ever do experience a buying trigger. That means staying in touch with them and being useful, not pushy or sales-y, on a regular basis.
For net new users, the sales cycle also isn’t dramatically different from any other software sales, Wright and Deraed agreed. “You need a [proof of concept], need to have proof of a business case, etc.,” Wright said.
Deraed said he explains it to new team members who come from a proprietary software sales background as like selling a traditional software license plus support contract — except that there’s no license in this case. The difference is you might have net new users who ultimately decide that your software is awesome — but they’ll be fine with the open source project.
Founder Sales and Embracing Rejection
Deraed echoed Erdenberger’s notion that CEOs have to do sales at the beginning — and that is true of all startups, not just open source companies.
“If the CEO doesn’t know why customers buy the product, the sales team won’t either,” Deraed said.
Wright had two specific pieces of advice for founders. The first is embracing rejection.
“You will lose 99% of deals,” he said. “Founders I’ve met have really struggled with this. At every stage of the funnel, you’re going to have about a 70% drop off.”
The second is that while you, as a founder, are thinking about your own company all day, every day, your customers aren’t. You’re just one thing on their massive to-do list, and you need to have patience as a result.
The true art of sales, Wright said, has nothing to do with whether or not your product is open source: “It’s literally saying, What is it you’re trying to achieve, and by when? And yes, I can help you do that.”

**Hacker News 讨论：**

文章主要讨论了开源软件向SaaS模式转型的挑战和策略。作者们指出，许多团队认为他们可以自己管理复杂的集群并节省成本，但实际上这会分散他们对产品开发的注意力。文章强调了以下几点：1. 对于那些能够自行管理集群的团队，他们可能不会购买SaaS服务；2. 开源软件的销售策略需要定位在工程师不关心的问题或技术上难以解决的问题；3. 开源软件作为一种分发策略，需要结合外部销售活动；4. 在低利率时代，开源SaaS业务可能更容易实现；5. 对于开源用户转为付费客户的情况，通常需要发生重大事件、关键人员变动或企业平台需求变化；6. 有一些公司通过提供“源代码可用”的模式来吸引客户，允许客户在本地运行、修改和分发软件，同时保持商业许可；7. 竞争加剧和AI技术的发展使得开源公司的护城河变得尤为重要。
