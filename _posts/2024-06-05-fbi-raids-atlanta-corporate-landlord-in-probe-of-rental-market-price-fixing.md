文章报道了美国联邦调查局（FBI）对全国性企业房东Cortland Management进行突袭搜查，以此加强对其涉嫌租金价格操纵阴谋的调查。该阴谋可能已经影响了数百万美国人。这次突袭搜查被认为是美国司法部（DOJ）对价值90亿美元的软件公司RealPage进行的刑事反垄断调查的一部分。RealPage向全美数百万套住房单位推荐租金上涨。文章指出，RealPage的算法根据房东提供的数据而非需求来提高租金，导致房东之间相互勾结，而非竞争。RealPage的影响在亚特兰大尤为明显，其软件定价影响了该市80%以上的租赁市场。

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) conducted an unannounced raid of national corporate landlord Cortland Management on May 22, ramping up an investigation into an alleged rental price-fixing conspiracy that may have already impacted millions of Americans.The surprise search was reportedly part of a criminal antitrust investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) into RealPage, a $9 billion software company that recommends rent raises on millions of housing units across the U.S.Per RealPage blog posts, Atlanta, Georgia-based Cortland, which owned nearly 85,000 apartment units as of June 2022, used RealPage's algorithm to "ensure consistent vendor pricing for their communities from Arizona to Georgia."

The problem with RealPage, according to multiple lawsuits filed in the past two years in California, Arizona, New York, and other states, is that its algorithm increases rental prices in response to data collected from landlords — not according to demand.Landlords "were not competing at all," Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes stated in a February lawsuit announcement against RealPage."They were colluding with one another," Mayes said.According to the Arizona lawsuit, and others filed, landlords gave RealPage detailed information about rent prices, lease terms, amenities, move-out dates, and occupancy rates.

"Using this sensitive data RealPage directed the competitors on which units to rent, when to rent them, and at what price," Mayes stated. "This was not a fair market at work, this was a fixed market."Related: State Attorney Generals Sue RealPage, Landlords Over 'Astronomical' Rent Hikes: 'This Was Not A Fair Market At Work'RealPage's reach is undeniable. A D.C. lawsuit showed that 60% of apartment buildings in the area set prices using RealPage. In Phoenix, Arizona, 70% of apartment units were owned or managed by companies using its software.Over 16 million rental units across the U.S. used RealPage's algorithm as of a 2020 blog post.

"That's a very large chunk of the total inventory in the country when you consider that there are about 22 million investment-grade apartments in the US today," Tracy Saffos, industry principal at RealPage, said in the same post.Related: Where Are Rents Dropping the Most in the U.S.?RealPage's impact on renters has been noticeable — even to executives at the company.When asked about the role RealPage's technology played in rising apartment rents, company executive Andrew Bowen said that the software was "driving it.""As a property manager, very few of us would be willing to actually raise rents double digits within a single month by doing it manually," Bowen said.Even though RealPage told CNBC that its landlord customers aren't required to use the rent increases its algorithm recommends, a 2022 investigation by ProPublica revealed that landlords accepted 80-90% of the algorithm's suggestions.RealPage sent out "pricing advisors" to meet with landlords in person to follow up on their use of its recommended rates, according to the February Arizona lawsuit against the company.In the past ten years, rent inflation has outpaced overall inflation numbers by 40.7%.Related: CPI Report: Rising Rent, Gas Prices Keep Inflation Up

**Hacker News 讨论：**

文章讨论了RealPage公司及其软件在租赁市场中的作用，以及它可能导致的非法价格操纵问题。文章指出，RealPage的软件可能被用来促进房地产公司之间的价格共谋，导致租金上涨。作者们认为，这种做法可能违反了反垄断法，并可能导致房东利用其软件来操纵市场。同时，文章也讨论了更广泛的问题，包括住房金融化、NIMBY主义（反对在本地建新房）以及大型私募股权公司对住房市场的影响。一些评论者认为，解决住房危机需要更全面的解决方案，而不仅仅是针对RealPage或类似公司的行动。
