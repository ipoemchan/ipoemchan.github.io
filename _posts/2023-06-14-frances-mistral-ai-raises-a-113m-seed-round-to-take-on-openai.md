Mistral AI，一家成立于巴黎的初创公司，获得了113百万美元的种子轮融资，旨在与OpenAI竞争大型语言模型和生成式AI的开发。该公司由Google DeepMind和Meta的校友共同创立，专注于开源解决方案和企业市场。Mistral AI计划在2024年发布其首个基于文本的生成式AI模型。投资方包括Lightspeed Venture Partners、Redpoint、Index Ventures等，估值达到2.4亿欧元。公司创始人认为，目前AI领域最大的挑战是“让AI变得有用”，并计划通过开源数据和模型来避免法律问题。

AI is well and truly off to the races: a startup that is only four weeks old has picked up a $113 million round of seed funding to compete against OpenAI in the building, training and application of large language models and generative AI.
Mistral AI, based out of Paris, is co-founded by alums from Google’s DeepMind and Meta and will be focusing on open source solutions and targeting enterprises to create what CEO Arthur Mensch believes is currently the biggest challenge in the field: “To make AI useful.” It plans to release its first models for text-based generative AI in 2024.
Lightspeed Venture Partners is leading this round, with Redpoint, Index Ventures, Xavier Niel, JCDecaux Holding, Rodolphe Saadé and Motier Ventures in France, La Famiglia and Headline in Germany, Exor Ventures in Italy, Sofina in Belgium, and First Minute Capital and LocalGlobe in the UK all also participating.
Mistral AI notes that French investment bank Bpifrance and former Google CEO Eric Schmidt are also shareholders. Sources close to the company confirm that the €105 million in funding ($113M at today’s rates) values Mistral AI €240 million ($260 million). To note, this is the same number that was being rumored about a month ago in the French press when people started chattering about the company.

Mensch (center), along with his co-founders Timothée Lacroix (CTO – L) and Guillaume Lample (Chief Science Officer – R), are all in their early thirties and have known each other since school, when they were all studying across the field of artificial intelligence.
Mensch was working at DeepMind in Paris, and Lacroix and Lample were at Meta’s Paris AI outpost; and Mensch said it was sometime last year that they got to talking about the direction they could see AI development taking.
“We could see the technology really start to accelerate last year,” he said in an interview today, most likely in reference to the leaps that OpenAI was making with its GPT model, which was a shot in the arm for a lot of people in AI and the wider world of tech.
But while OpenAI has the word “open” in its name, it felt like anything but. Mensch, Lacroix and Lample felt that a proprietary approach was largely shaping up to be the norm, and they saw an opportunity to do things differently. “Open source is a core part of our DNA,” Mensch noted.
It’s very early to talk about what Mistral is doing or will be doing — it’s only around a month old — but from what Mensch said, the plan is to build models using only publicly available data to avoid legal issues that some others have faced over training data, he said; users will be able to contribute their own datasets, too. Models and data sets will be open-sourced, as well.
Stability AI has also been in the spotlight, though not in a good way.
But Antoine Moyroud, who led the investment for Lightspeed (which also backed Stability AI, I should point out), said that he believes it’s a leap worth taking.
“For us at Lightspeed, we didn’t work in isolation,” he said in an interview. “We had a chance to see a few strong tech teams looking to raise funding to build LLM across India, the U.S. and Europe. But what was lacking was while they were strong technically they hadn’t thought about the second order effects of LLM.” That is to say, they were not thinking of where and how they might be applied.
He likens the AI landscape to bigger infrastructure plays like cloud computing and database businesses, not applications. “We think value will accrue here as it has in the cloud, where there will be 5-6 players getting the lion’s share.
“Then we thought who are the most credible here? Then we met with the Mistral founders. It’s a very talented team. We think there are only 70-100 people in the world right now with their expertise for language models and optimizing them.” Lample, as one example, led the development of LLaMA, Meta’s Large Language Model, and he was leading the LLM team at Meta before he left to co-found Mistral AI.
On another note, the fact that AI startups are getting VCs to open their checkbooks is notable. The Googles, Apples, Metas, Amazons, Microsofts, etc. of the world will definitely make their plays in this space, but the fact that startups are being formed and are finding willing recruits is a signal that it’s not all game over just yet.
A mistral is a north wind that blows down Europe, and usually when it blows that is a sign of good weather in the days following. The startup may well be hoping for the same effect here.
San Francisco people often refer to their “uncanny valley,” but at the end of the day, Mensch said he believes that there has to be a credible effort from all around the world to build and take some ownership of how AI will develop. This is Mistral’s play to give France a shot at that.
Its plan is to use the funding to assemble what he describes as a “world class team” creating “the best open source models,” he said, and it will definitely now have some money to blow through to do just that.

**Hacker News 讨论：**

文章讨论了Mistral这个AI初创公司，它正在使用公开数据构建模型以避免法律问题，并计划开源其模型和数据集。尽管Mistral目前还没有产品，但已经完成了1130万美元的种子轮融资，估值2.4亿美元。一些评论者对这种做法表示怀疑，认为这是典型的“年轻且炒作”的欧洲商业模式，而另一些评论者则赞扬了团队的背景和经验。文章还提到了Mistral与法国政治家和欧盟AI法规的关系。
